In the process of writing this thesis, I have received a great deal of support and assistance.
I would first like to thank my supervisors, Professor Naoki Akai and Professor Susumu Hara,
whose expertise was invaluable in the formulating of the research topic and methodology
in particular. Professor Hara, thank you for giving me a valuable opportunity to study and research in your lab as an undergraduate researcher. Professor Akai, thank you for introducing me to ROS, guiding me in my first tentative steps in the Linux world and have helped develop a stronger desire to continue to pursue research in the robotics field.

I would love to thank my family in Vietnam, especially my father - Quan Le, my mother - Thinh Tran and my sister - Ha Le, for always supporting 
me whenever I need throughout this journey. 
I would love to thank my senpai - Truong Phan, 
for his continuous guidance and support during my 4 years at 
Nagoya University. I would also love to thank my kouhai - 
Thanh Nguyen for helping me filming my experiments. Finally, 
I would like to thank all lab colleagues and seniors in the 
laboratory, especially the ARIC team with Arashi-san, Yasui-san and Kane-san.
